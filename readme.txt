Project 5: Recognition using Deep Networks
This project is part of the CS 5330 course on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision, and aims to build, train, analyze, and modify a deep network for a recognition task using the MNIST dataset, a Greek letter dataset, and the MNIST fashion dataset.

Usage
To run the code, make sure you have PyTorch and torchvision installed. Then, download the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for the desired task.

Tasks
The project includes the following tasks:

Build and train a network to recognize digits
Examine the network
Transfer learning on Greek letters
Variation of hyper-parameters
The results and analysis for each task can be found in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Dependencies
PyTorch
torchvision
